# cython_examples
In this repo I keep cython practices and benchmarking that I do for my research. 


## Cases:

### Case 1: Bubble sort

You can run the the `benchmark.py` file to see the difference between the python, cython, and c implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

Results: 

```
Python Sort - Time: 8.5990 s, Memory: 58.91 MiB
Cython Sort - Time: 0.4879 s, Memory: 59.02 MiB
C Sort - Time: 0.8932 s, Memory: 60.14 MiB
```
